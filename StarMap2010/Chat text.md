ALright... looks good.  There was a variant made for special operations, but visually looks the same as standard model.  Upgraded with a standard small medical bay and stealth systems.   Capacity for extended missions behind enemy lines.  Most were destroyed but a few slipped through the cracks and ended up as surplus.  Very few.
One of these Black Iron vessels is going to be the hero ship.  I like Black Iron better.  Owner/operator has a "de-militarized" Black Iron, the Farther Star.  
Currently one crew.  The pilot/owner.  Got the Star when mustering out at wars end.  Just happened to be at the depot when it was being demilitarized buying a surplus Ironfall.  Asked the Sergeant if he could have that one and the Sergeant not knowing better said sure.  
The owner flew Black Irons and specifically the star during the war.  Wasn't SO officially but you can't be with them for long periods in dangerous situations without picking something up.  
From where the last prompt finished, write the fleets/military prompt for the other session.  Include the Ironfall and Black Iron just as if they were another ship.  Include any new ships that would make sense that could have survived the war.  Might even include new versions built post-war.  Think the strategic bombers and fighters that were developed and retired in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.  Then write up a narative just for me to be used in writing a story of the Farther Star and suggest a name and background for the pilot.  Include a senior officer that was SO and now a government spook that did not like the pilot and remembers him.
You didn't do the other fleets in the prompt?
wright the prompt for marine/army
Design the marine company that would be on an Iron Fall, then the SO team that would be on a Black Iron.
Give me a better name for the pilot.  Also Major Althea Korrin is a male and was a LTC.  The pilot didn't abort an extraction, he disobeyed orders to pull out a team as the war was being ended and the team was being abandoned.
do a male version of Althea Korrin
I like Caleb.  Caleb Johnathon Mosby.  Get the reference?  Cahnge Althea to a masculian version.
Alastair Korrin, lock it in.  Look up John Moseby to get the reference.  Korrin hates Moseby, not a hot burning hate, a cold hatred.  Moseby was insubordinate, lacked proper military bearing, and was only able to get away with it because he was a damn good pilot that could go into places and come out alive that noone else had the nerve or skill to do.  Korrin was going to court marshal Moseby but Moseby was mustered out and disappeared before he could bring charges.  Due to Moseby extraction of the SO team, command "suggested" the matter be dropped as it would bring attention to the operation.
Mosby "retired" to a quiet, out of the way world with shallow seas, good weather, and small islands with low populations.  He makes short cargo/passenger runs on a regular schedule to some of the nearby systems.  Keeps him in money and the Farther Star in fuel.  Most of the time he spends "fishing" without bait with the Star docked on a concrete pier that reaches out into the ocean.  
Down in Panama, they take school buses and paint them up.  See what you can dig up on that.  I can see that they locals painted the hull of the star the same way.  Caleb doesn't mind because it helps the star blend in.
Write the scene
I can see Mosby sitting in a beach chair, fishing line in the water, a cooler of beer beside him, in the shade under the nose of the Star.  The front and aft ramps down to let the salt breeze blow through to keep things cool.
No sand.  He is on a concrete pier.  The gull is fine, but this is another planet.
What do you think?
At this point I see a couple of ground vehicles approaching.  Ground vehicles are used on this world because aircraft are expensive and hard to get parts for.  So people use cars and trucks.  The passengers are local guide/drivers, a couple of spook security, Korrin and a female spook.
THe female spook is a not human human.  Alien, perhaps a divergent human race from the seeding millinuem ago.  
Korrin can recall, requisition, or plain old commander the Star.  The spooks NEED the Star.  She has a clean history civilian wise but can still do all the things needed for a Spook mission.  They want Caleb also and will use the Star as leverage.  Korrin would love to stick to Caleb if it gets to that point.
Now we need a mission.  Sael will be going with Moseby.  It will take a while to get there.
Can you do everything so far in one long narration?
Seems Caleb gave in too easy.  Korrin should be correcting Caleb that he isn't military anymore... but something more dangerous.  Just two ground vehicles.  SUV types.  
no... Korrin is something worse than military... he is a spook.. some government agency that can do things, make people disappear.
I feel like Korrin needs to try to pressure Caleb to take on a job for the spooks first.  At some point Caleb should ask Why Me?  This is where Korring can let Caleb know what he thinks of him, that he doens't like him but that he is good.  Caleb says no, then Korrin leverages the Star.  Sael is a spook as well and tries to be the almost good cop in the exchange.
