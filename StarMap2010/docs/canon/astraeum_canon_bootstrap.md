# Astraeum Canon Bootstrap

## CANON TIMELINE
Current year: **2548 CE**  
Major war ended: **2544 CE**  

Post-war political tension remains active.  
Many systems are rebuilding, demilitarizing, or consolidating power.  
Travel restrictions and border suspicion are common.

## FTL & TRAVEL MODEL

There are two primary interstellar travel methods:

### Gate Network
• Fastest and most efficient  
• Heavily monitored and politically controlled  
• Trade, military, and civilian traffic depend on gates  
• Gate access can be delayed, denied, or manipulated bureaucratically  

### Direct FTL (Drift Transit)
• Slower than gates  
• Harder to detect and regulate  
• Used by traders, explorers, and covert operations  
• Requires fuel, maintenance, and navigation skill  
• Long-range direct FTL is risky but possible  

**Gate routes = control**  
**Drift routes = freedom (and danger)**

## SHIP CLASS CANON

### Black Iron Assault Shuttle
• Originally a special forces insertion craft  
• Designed for stealth, survivability, and independent operation  
• Can land in hostile environments  
• Hard to detect when flown by a skilled pilot  
• Rare in civilian hands  

Example: *Father Star* (Mosby’s ship)

## MAJOR POWERS (POST-WAR)

### Solaria
Industrial, bureaucratic, pragmatic  
Values order, logistics, and strategic control  

### Thalean Houses
Aristocratic, subtle, status-driven  
Operate through influence and long strategy  

### Astraeum Protectorate
Culturally unified, spiritually structured  
Deeply influenced by **Luminoti philosophy**  
Territorial but not overtly expansionist  

Tension between these powers remains high but undeclared.

## BELIEF AS BEHAVIOR MODEL

In Astraeum, belief is not decorative — it is infrastructural.

Belief systems influence:
• Law  
• Technology policy  
• Trade access  
• Social structure  
• War doctrine  

Faith traditions are not always religious, but they are always operational.

## TECHNOLOGY TONE

Astraeum technology is:
• Advanced but practical  
• Durable, repairable, and field-modified  
• Not sleek utopia tech  
• Not decayed grimdark tech  

Ships show wear. Equipment gets patched. People improvise.

---

## NARRATIVE TONE

Astraeum stories favor:
• Character-driven decisions  
• Moral ambiguity without nihilism  
• Quiet competence over flashy heroics  
• Consequences that ripple outward  
• Subtle worldbuilding revealed through action  

Avoid:
• Exposition dumps  
• Clear good vs evil binaries  
• Technobabble solutions

## THE CARETAKER CONCEPT

The Caretaker is not widely known.

Rumors describe it as:
• A guardian of technological thresholds  
• A limiter against civilization-ending advancements  
• Something that can move between hosts  
• Something governments want to control or eliminate  

Its true nature is obscure even to those pursuing it.
