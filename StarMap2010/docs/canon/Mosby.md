The early rain had given way to what could only be described as a spectacular mid-morning. Warm and humid, as expected. The pier smelled of the sea—salt, algae, and old concrete baked smooth by decades of sun.
Caleb Mosby sat in a beach chair beneath the shadow of Farther Star’s nose, the fabric stretched low enough to be comfortable and just inconvenient enough to discourage getting up. In one hand he held a fishing pole, the line trailing lazily into the water below. In the other was a beer that was slowly getting warm.
No matter. There were more in the cooler beside him, nestled in ice scavenged from the Star’s galley.
The Star was his ship. Supposedly a relic from the last war—surplus—but she was his. An assault shuttle once used to put men and steel into places the other side didn’t want them. Both the forward and aft loading ramps were down, clamshell doors open wide, letting the salt breeze roll through the cargo bay and out the far end, keeping the interior from turning into an oven beneath the tropical sun.
Brightwater was still being terraformed—nearly finished—but that hadn’t stopped people from settling early. Shallow seas and chains of small islands, originally planned with leisure in mind, marked it as a pleasure world that never quite got its chance. The pier itself had once anchored a massive terraforming engine, long since stripped down and hauled away.
The war had turned the place into a backwater.
Who wanted to vacation so close to somewhere another war might break out at any time?
The people who came anyway called it home. They had taken Mosby in as one of their own, even if he never said it that way.
A slap of wood against metal broke the quiet, followed by the clink of a paint can.
Mosby didn’t have to look to know who it was—but he did anyway.
Manny was at it again.
Every so often the old man would show up unannounced and start painting the hull of the Star. Bright, garish colors exploded across the once-drab plating—saints, icons, symbols, scriptures from a thousand different religions Mosby couldn’t name. Somewhere along the port side was a grinning portrait Manny called The King. Elvis, whoever that was.
Early on, Mosby had tried to stop it.
The old man was halfway through a saint’s face when Mosby stepped toward the hull, already forming the words he’d use to put an end to it. He never got them out.
A local boy—no more than eight or nine—darted in front of him and grabbed his wrist with both hands. The grip was small, but desperate.
“No, mister,” the boy said, eyes wide and serious. “Bad juju if you don’t let him.”
Before Mosby could answer, the boy turned, crossed himself with exaggerated care, and ran back toward the town without looking back.
Mosby stood there for a moment, caught between irritation and confusion. By the time he looked up again, Manny was still painting, unbothered and precise, as if nothing at all had happened.
Mosby let him finish.
Manny himself was thin and wiry, like most folks who lived here long enough. He was perched near the top rung of a ladder lashed to the hull, paint pails hanging from hooks, brush dancing in his hand like it knew where to go without being told.
“What are you painting this time?” Mosby called.
“Eyes,” Manny replied without looking down. “Ship needs eyes. Needs to see, bring you back safe.”
Mosby sighed.
He never understood the need to paint nearly every vehicle on the islands in an explosion of color and style. At first he’d tried to persuade Manny not to touch the ship. He’d been politely ignored.
The explanation never changed.
“The ship,” Manny had said once, tapping the hull affectionately, “she has a home now. And we want her know she belongs.”
Mosby leaned back in his chair, fishing line still drifting, beer warming in his hand, and let the breeze pass through the open bay.
For now, that was enough.
A bottle later, Manny had changed sides and was nearly finished.
The hull looked louder now—eyes complete, lines sharpened, a few last strokes added where Manny felt the ship still needed them. He was rinsing a brush when the sound reached them: engines, low and deliberate, coming along the pier.
Mosby noticed immediately.
Most people didn’t drive this way. They walked along the beach instead—shorter, easier, and cooler underfoot. Vehicles meant purpose. Vehicles meant outsiders.
Manny didn’t look up.
“People come see you,” he said in the local pidgin, voice casual. “They arrive spaceport yesterday. Stay government house last night.”
Mosby frowned slightly and took another drink. The bottle was nearly three-quarters gone now.
He considered who would travel all the way out here to see him—and why Manny, of all people, would know about it.
“What do they want with me?” Mosby asked.
Manny climbed down the ladder, joints popping, and began sealing the paint cans with practiced care.
“Not for me say,” he replied.
He slung the cans into a netted carrier and started up the beach toward his house without another word.
Mosby watched him go.
He had no doubt the old man knew exactly who they were and why they’d come. There wasn’t much that happened on the islands that didn’t pass through Manny’s ears sooner or later. The locals treated him with a careful respect, half affection, half superstition—like a man who listened more than he spoke and remembered everything.
Mosby leaned back in his chair, eyes drifting toward the far end of the pier where the sound of the vehicles was growing clearer. He set the empty bottle beside the cooler and reached for another without opening it yet.
The breeze still moved through Farther Star’s open bay.
But the quiet had started to thin.
Two vehicles stopped where the road ended and gravel gave way to sand.
Six people got out.
Two were local police—uniforms faded by sun and salt, posture relaxed but alert. Two more had the look and bearing that announced agency security: neutral clothing, deliberate movements, eyes that never quite stopped working.
One of the remaining two was a woman.
But it was the last man who caught—and held—Mosby’s attention.
Colonel Alastair Korrin.
No uniform. No visible authority. And yet he stood there for a moment, motionless, as if he were about to dress down some young marine who’d failed to stand at attention. His gaze swept the scene methodically: Mosby in the chair, the beer, the fishing pole. Then it reached the ship.
It stopped there.
A visible grimace crossed Korrin’s face.
He turned to one of the security men and took a folder from him, flipping it open without breaking stride. Satisfied, he closed it as he started across the sand toward the pier, walking with the clipped, purposeful pace of a man who expected the ground to cooperate. The woman followed a step behind him.
Mosby noticed immediately that she wasn’t bothered by the Star’s appearance. Her eyes moved differently—taking in details instead of reacting to them. The hull, the open ramps, the breeze moving through the bay. Then him. Then the breakwater. Then the ocean beyond.
She looked human.
But something about her didn’t quite settle.
Before Mosby could place it, they reached the pier and stopped a few meters away.
“Captain Caleb Mosby,” Korrin said, his voice flat, the words clipped like he was biting back something sharper.
Mosby didn’t stand.
“Lieutenant Colonel Alaric Korrin,” he replied, equally flat, not bothering to acknowledge the woman with him. He let the title hang there—outdated and deliberate.
Korrin’s jaw tightened. “I have an assignment for you—”
“No,” Mosby said, cutting him off without raising his voice. “I’m not in your unit anymore. You don’t get to order me around.”
Korrin’s eyes flicked briefly to the Star, then back.
Mosby turned his head and met his gaze. “I’m out. That’s what discharged means.”
Korrin’s expression tightened, the color rising in his face despite his effort to contain it.
Before he could speak, the woman stepped forward.
The movement was unhurried, precise, placing her just enough between them to change the shape of the moment without challenging it.
“We’re not asking you to enlist,” she said calmly, a faint, practiced smile touching her lips. “Just to fly.”
“It’s never that simple, is it, Colonel,” Mosby said coldly. “It wasn’t then, and it isn’t now. So why me? And why now?”
“We need someone who can fly into places others can’t,” Korrin said. “And a ship that can get there.”
His mouth tightened.
“And,” he said, “because I don’t like you.”
The woman did not react to Korrin’s admission. If anything, she looked faintly relieved that it had been said aloud.
“That’s not the whole of it,” she said smoothly, before Mosby could respond. “But it’s close enough to be honest.”
Korrin shot her a sharp look. She ignored it.
She turned her attention fully to Mosby then, posture open without being casual, hands folded loosely in front of her as if this were a conversation she’d been expecting to have all along.
“You have a ship that can enter contested space without announcing itself,” she continued. “You have clearance histories that still resolve in the gate system, even if they shouldn’t. And you have experience flying without support, without oversight, and without the expectation that anyone is coming to help you if things go wrong.”
Mosby listened without comment.
“And,” she added, “you are here.”
Korrin folded his arms. “Don’t flatter him.”
“I’m not,” she said, still looking at Mosby. “I’m explaining why this didn’t go to a committee.”
She took a step closer, close enough now that Mosby could see the faint lines at the corners of her eyes—not age, exactly, but use. The look of someone who watched people decide things that mattered.
“We’re not asking you to rejoin anything,” she said again. “No uniform. No command structure. No flag on your hull.”
Korrin exhaled through his nose. “For now.”
She didn’t contradict him.
“What we’re asking,” she went on, “is that you take the Star somewhere we cannot officially go, and come back with what you find. Or who.”
Mosby’s gaze drifted past her—to the ship. To the paint drying on the hull. To the open ramps and the breeze moving through the bay like it always had.
“And if I say no?” he asked.
“You don’t,” Korrin snapped. The restraint finally broke. “You can be recalled to service and ordered.”
Mosby didn’t move.
“And your ship,” Korrin went on, the words sharpening into something personal. “How you got it. Why it was released. All of that can be reviewed.” He sneered, gesturing toward the riot of color on the hull. “Government property reclaimed. Frankly, it’d be cheaper to scrap it than try to strip all that off.”
“You try that,” Mosby said calmly, “and half your paperwork eats the other half. The rest gets buried so deep no one admits it ever existed.”
For a moment, neither of them spoke.
Korrin’s expression shifted—not rage, not surprise. Recognition. The look of a man reminded that some things had never gone the way he’d planned.
“You always did think you knew better,” Korrin said quietly.
Mosby met his eyes. “I did.”
The woman stepped forward before Korrin could push it further, her movement smooth, unhurried. She gave Korrin a look—measured, warning, final. He stopped.
“Things don’t have to be adversarial,” she said evenly. “If you say no, you remain free.”
She let that settle.
“It will simply take more effort to stay that way. Licenses take longer. Fuel costs more. Gate access stops resolving cleanly. Nothing dramatic. Nothing you could point to.”
She met Mosby’s eyes and held them.
Mosby smiled faintly.
“That’s what you call not ordering me around,” he said.
She inclined her head, acknowledging the point. “It’s what I call telling you the shape of the world you’re already in.”
Mosby studied her for a long moment.
“You are worse than that bastard.”
There was a twitch at the corner of her mouth when he said it.
The words weren’t loud. There was no heat in them. Just fatigue, and something old that had finally been allowed to surface.
For the first time since she’d stepped onto the pier, she didn’t answer immediately. She turned her gaze to the ocean and let it sit there—long enough to feel deliberate, not evasive.
“Can I have a moment alone with Mr. Mosby,” she said at last, holding her hand out without looking at Korrin.
The request was polite. The gesture wasn’t.
Korrin hesitated, the folder still in his hand. For a moment it looked like he might argue, might reclaim ground he’d already lost. Then his jaw tightened and he handed it to her instead.
She took it, didn’t open it, and tucked it under her arm.
“Wait by the vehicles,” she added.
Korrin turned away without a word. The security men followed, boots crunching softly as they moved back toward the road. The local police drifted off as well, leaving the pier to the sound of water and wind again.
Only then did Mosby really look at her.
She was tall, though not in a way that demanded notice. Long lines, balanced proportions, everything about her arranged for efficiency rather than display. She stood easily in the heat, weight centered, posture relaxed without ever becoming loose. Not Solarian drill. Something quieter. More ingrained.
Her features were fine-boned and even, skin smooth and unmarked by sun or scar. The humidity hadn’t touched her the way it touched everyone else on the pier. Her hair was pulled back simply, dark and glossy, held in place without ornament. No jewelry. No visible tech. Nothing unnecessary.
Her eyes met his.
They were dark and steady, attentive without pressing. She didn’t stare. She observed, letting the moment come to her. When she looked at Mosby, it wasn’t curiosity or judgment. It was assessment—complete and unhurried.
She looked human.
She just didn’t look Solarian.
“But he’s not wrong about one thing,” she said. “This situation exists whether you participate or not.”
Mosby nodded once.
“Who are you?” he asked.
She reached down, opened the folder, and slid a single sheet free. Not credentials. Not orders. A travel authorization, already populated. She set it on the crate between them and turned it so he could read it.
“My name is Sael,” she said. “And I’ll be going with you.”
“That wasn’t the question,” Mosby said.
“It’s the part that matters,” Sael replied. “Names are only useful when someone has to share space with you.”
Mosby glanced at the page, then back at her. “You don’t look like cargo.”
“I’m not,” she said. “I’m there to make sure this doesn’t become something it shouldn’t.”
Mosby got up out of the chair, reaching for the folder.
“Let me see what this is all about.”
She didn’t hand it to him.
She watched him for a moment, measuring something that had nothing to do with the paper. Then she closed the folder and tucked it back under her arm.
For a heartbeat, that seemed final.
“All right,” she said.
She handed it to him.
“I’ll be back this evening,” she added. “After you’ve looked things over and thought about it.”
She turned and walked back toward the vehicles without waiting for a reply. Korrin was already there, rigid beside the transport, eyes fixed anywhere but the pier. Doors closed. Engines started. Gravel crunched as the vehicles rolled away and disappeared beyond the rise.
Mosby stood on the pier with the folder in his hand, the Star breathing behind him, the paint on her hull still drying in the sun.
A bit later, Manny came back.
He went straight to the ladder where it already leaned against the Star’s forward flank and climbed the rungs, stopping to look over the hull. He tilted his head slightly, not searching, just taking it in.
Mosby watched from the chair, the folder still unopened on his knee.
Manny rested his hand on the metal near one of the newly painted eyes. The paint was still tacky. He left his hand there a moment longer than necessary. His lips moved, the sound too soft to make out—words without shape, carried more by habit than intent.
He drew his hand back.
“They coming back,” Manny said 
“Yes,” Mosby said.
Manny nodded once. “You going with them?” he asked.
Mosby glanced at the folder, then back at the ship. “I don’t know yet. Don’t know I have choice.”
Manny accepted that without comment.
“She got eyes now. That helps,” he said finally, as he gathered his things and started back toward town, unhurried.
Mosby didn’t open the folder right away.


As the afternoon wore on, Mosby read the dossier in the folder and read it again.
It was thin. Almost insultingly so.
Fly to the Ael-Runn system.
Wait.
Then return.
No contingencies. No timelines beyond soon. No explanation of what was being waitied for.
The problem wasn’t the instructions.
The problem was Ael-Runn.
The system lay inside the Astraum Protectorate, and the Protectorate had never been subtle about who it tolerated in its space. Officially neutral, culturally rigid, and fiercely territorial, they were known for treating uninvited traffic as a philosophical failing rather than a navigational error.
Most of their citizens were not fanatics—at least not in the way Solaria defined the word—but they were deeply steeped in the Luminoti. Belief there wasn’t ornamental. It was structural.
That alone would have made the job delicate.
That the last war had been fought between Solaria and Thalean forces on one side and Astraum and its allies on the other made it something else entirely.
As he considered his options, Mosby realized he hadn’t eaten yet that day. Judging by the angle of the sun lowering toward the water, he could expect company soon as well.
With a sigh, he set the folder aside and pulled out a small grill. After a moment’s hesitation, he added a narrow table and two chairs.
As the sun touched the ocean and the local prawns neared the end of their time on the grill, Mosby heard footsteps on the rear ramp.
He didn’t turn.
Sael came up into the cargo bay with an easy, unhurried grace, as if the ship had already agreed to her presence. She paused just inside, her attention drawn to the built-in equipment racks along the bulkhead—scarred mounts, lock points polished by use, the quiet geometry of things meant to survive hard landings.
Then she continued forward, passing through the bay and out onto the pier-side opening.
“I didn’t hear you drive up,” Mosby observed.
“I walked down the beach, I don’t get to enjoy the sites often.  That smells good,” she said. “I didn’t know you could cook.”
Mosby flipped one of the prawns, watching the shell darken and split.
“Ship rations get old after a while,” he said. “So I learned to cook whatever the local economy has to offer.” He turned the next one with practiced care. “And folks in town can’t always pay in credits. I take trade—whatever they can spare.”
“They rely on you, then,” Sael said.
“Not too many traders come this way,” Mosby replied. “I run a regular route every month—Aureline, Kallamar, Paralax, a few nearby systems.” He began transferring the prawns to a plate. “It doesn’t make much more than fuel and maintenance, but I don’t need much more.”
He set the plate down, steam rising in the cooling air.
“It helps people out. Brings in medicine, mail. Things we don’t have locally.”
Sael studied him for a moment. Not his face—his hands, the way he moved, the way the ship sat open behind him.
“Mind if I sit?” she asked.
“Go ahead,” Mosby said, placing the plate at the center of the table. “Have you eaten?”
“I had something in town,” she said, taking the chair. “But it wasn’t as good as this smells.”
“Hang on,” Mosby said.
He disappeared into the ship and returned a moment later with another plate, a bottle of wine, and two glasses.
“You’ve had time to read the dossier,” she said, as he poured the wine and handed her a glass.
“I did.”
Mosby sat and served a portion onto each plate. The prawns steamed faintly in the cooling air. He didn’t rush to eat.  After a moment, he went on. “There wasn’t much to it. We leave here, head to the Ael-Ruun system, land, wait while you do whatever it is you’re there to do, then come back.” He glanced at her over the rim of his glass. “If that’s really all there is, you could’ve booked passage on a commercial liner. Would’ve been cheaper. Quieter, too.”
Sael took a sip of wine and held the glass for a moment before setting it down. She studied him—not weighing the words, but the way he’d chosen them.
“You know it isn’t that simple,” she said.
Mosby gave a short, humorless snort. “Yeah. I do.” He leaned back slightly in his chair. “And it’s going to be rougher than you’re letting on.”
She didn’t interrupt.
“Ael-Ruun sits inside the Protectorate,” he continued. “They’re touchy about who comes into their space on a good day. After the war?” He shook his head. “They don’t see outsiders as visitors. They see them as problems.”
He finally picked up his fork, more out of habit than appetite.
“And that’s before you factor in the Luminoti.”
Sael’s expression didn’t change—but something behind her eyes did.  Finally she admitted it. 
“Of course,” Sael said. “That’s why you’re flying me in.”
She took a bite, then paused. Her expression shifted—not surprise, but genuine pleasure.
“Oh,” she said quietly. “This is good.”
She ate another bite before continuing, as if the food had earned her patience.
“You flew into worse places during the war,” she went on. “I read your file. Even the classified parts.” She met his eyes over the rim of her glass. “At least no one is shooting at you this time.”
Mosby set his fork down.
The sound was soft, deliberate.
“We won’t have a team of operators backing us up either,” he said. “No overwatch. No extraction window. Just you, me, and the Star.”
Sael didn’t interrupt. That was telling.
“I can fly her,” Mosby continued. “I can keep us out of trouble most days. But if this goes sideways—and it will—I’m going to need someone who can keep the ship working while I’m busy doing something else.”
He watched her carefully now.
“Engineering,” he said. “And it wouldn’t hurt if they knew how to move in places where questions come with consequences.”
He let that sit between them.
Sael took another bite, slower this time. Thoughtful.
“You already have someone in mind,” she said.
Mosby didn’t answer right away. He picked up his glass, took a sip, then nodded once.
“An old contact,” he said. “Not Solarian. Not Astraeum either. Knows how to fix things that were never meant to break—and people who know things they shouldn’t.”
She studied him for a long moment.
“A Talarian,” she said finally, a faint crease forming between her brows.
She took another drink, then rolled the wine slowly in her glass, watching the light catch in it.
“All right,” she said. “Anything else?”
Mosby didn’t answer right away. He finished his food, set the fork down carefully, and wiped his hands on a cloth that had seen better days.
“Yeah,” he said. “It’s a long run, even if we don’t miss a gate. Transit fees. Fuel. Maintenance. Supplies.” He ticked them off without looking at her. “I’ll be gone longer than a casual job. I’ll need time to line someone up to run my route while I’m out. I’m not leaving people here without medicine or mail because you showed up with a folder.”
She nodded once, accepting that without comment.
“I want two hundred thousand credits,” Mosby went on. “Half up front. And another hundred thousand to cover the Talarian.”
Sael didn’t blink.
She set her glass down, reached into her jacket, and extended her hand across the table.
“Agreed.”
The word landed too quickly. Too cleanly.
Mosby didn’t take her hand.
“You didn’t even ask why,” he said.
“I don’t need to,” she replied. “That number tells me how dangerous you think this is. And how much you’re willing to tolerate being lied to.”
That earned a faint, humorless breath from him.
“You’re not even pretending this is a negotiation.”
She met his eyes. “You weren’t pretending either.”
For a moment they sat there, the sound of the water below the pier filling the space between them. Somewhere behind them, the Star’s cooling systems ticked softly as metal adjusted to the evening air.
Finally, Mosby took her hand.
Her grip was firm. Not dominant. Not tentative. Just certain.
The rest of the evening passed with charts spread across the table and the last of the wine going warm in their glasses.
Sael preferred the gate routes—clean, predictable, officially sanctioned.
Mosby shook his head.
“That’s the obvious way,” he said, tapping the display and pushing it aside. “Which means it’s watched.”
He brought up a secondary map, older and less refined, dotted with systems most traffic ignored.
“We come in from here,” he said, indicating a nearby star off the main routes. “No gates leading in. Local patrols will be concentrated on the other side of the system. We ride the gravity wells—use the gas giants to mask our approach.”
Sael leaned closer, studying the geometry. “They’ll still have sensors.”
“They’ll have expectations,” Mosby replied. “That’s not the same thing.”
She glanced up at him.
“Assault shuttles were stealthy by design,” he continued. “The Iron Fall class especially. Low-emission hulls, baffled drives, sensor profiles meant to look like debris if you didn’t know what you were looking for.” He paused. “With the right pilot.”
Sael’s eyes flicked briefly toward the open bay, to the painted hull and the shadows crawling across it as night set in.
“The Farther Star is a Black Iron,” Mosby said. “Outfitted for insertion with even more advanced stealth with passive electronic warfare . Sit quiet. Wait. Leave without anyone ever being sure we were there. They were slated to be scrapped after the war.”
Sael leaned back slightly.
“Korrin knew this,” she said.
It wasn’t a question.
Mosby didn’t answer immediately. He adjusted the chart, rotated it a few degrees, then finally nodded once.
“Yeah,” he said. “He did.”
That settled between them heavier than any plotted trajectory.
Sael looked back at the charts, but her focus had shifted. Not routes now—motives.
“Which means,” she said carefully, “this wasn’t about finding a pilot.”
“No,” Mosby said. “It was about finding me.”
For the first time that evening, her expression tightened—not surprise, but confirmation.
“All right,” she said at last. “When do we leave?”
“Two or three days,” Mosby replied. “I need time to send a few messages and wait for the answers. In the meantime, I’ll prep the Star. Load provisions. Cargo.”
Sael raised an eyebrow. “Cargo?”
“An empty trader draws attention,” Mosby said. “Cargo looks legitimate. And a few extra credits never hurt.”
She considered that, then nodded once. “All right.”
She stood, glancing out toward the water where the waves struck the pier in a steady, patient rhythm. Gathering her things, she turned back to him.
“It’s late,” she said. “And it looks like we’ll both be busy. I’ll head back to the government house. Leave word there when you’re ready.”
Mosby watched her step away, then asked, “You going to be all right walking back alone?”
She paused, just long enough to look over her shoulder.
A brief, predatory smile touched her lips.
“I don’t think there’s anything out here,” she said, “that I can’t handle.”
Then she turned and walked off into the darkening evening, leaving Mosby alone with the charts, the ship, and the growing certainty that whatever waited for them wasn’t finished revealing its shape yet.
