The early rain had given way to what could only be described as a spectacular mid-morning. Warm and humid, as expected. The pier smelled of the sea—salt, algae, and old concrete baked smooth by decades of sun.
Caleb Mosby sat in a beach chair beneath the shadow of Farther Star’s nose, the fabric stretched low enough to be comfortable and just inconvenient enough to discourage getting up. In one hand he held a fishing pole, the line trailing lazily into the water below. In the other was a beer that was slowly getting warm.
No matter. There were more in the cooler beside him, nestled in ice scavenged from the Star’s galley.
The Star was his ship. Supposedly a relic from the last war—surplus—but she was his. An assault shuttle once used to put men and steel into places the other side didn’t want them. Both the forward and aft loading ramps were down, clamshell doors open wide, letting the salt breeze roll through the cargo bay and out the far end, keeping the interior from turning into an oven beneath the tropical sun.
Brightwater was still being terraformed—nearly finished—but that hadn’t stopped people from settling early. Shallow seas and chains of small islands, originally planned with leisure in mind, marked it as a pleasure world that never quite got its chance. The pier itself had once anchored a massive terraforming engine, long since stripped down and hauled away.
The war had turned the place into a backwater.
Who wanted to vacation so close to somewhere another war might break out at any time?
The people who came anyway called it home. They had taken Mosby in as one of their own, even if he never said it that way.
A slap of wood against metal broke the quiet, followed by the clink of a paint can.
Mosby didn’t have to look to know who it was—but he did anyway.
Manny was at it again.
Every so often the old man would show up unannounced and start painting the hull of the Star. Bright, garish colors exploded across the once-drab plating—saints, icons, symbols, scriptures from a thousand different religions Mosby couldn’t name. Somewhere along the port side was a grinning portrait Manny called The King. Elvis, whoever that was.
Early on, Mosby had tried to stop it.
The old man was halfway through a saint’s face when Mosby stepped toward the hull, already forming the words he’d use to put an end to it. He never got them out.
A local boy—no more than eight or nine—darted in front of him and grabbed his wrist with both hands. The grip was small, but desperate.
“No, mister,” the boy said, eyes wide and serious. “Bad juju if you don’t let him.”
Before Mosby could answer, the boy turned, crossed himself with exaggerated care, and ran back toward the town without looking back.
Mosby stood there for a moment, caught between irritation and confusion. By the time he looked up again, Manny was still painting, unbothered and precise, as if nothing at all had happened.
Mosby let him finish.
Manny himself was thin and wiry, like most folks who lived here long enough. He was perched near the top rung of a ladder lashed to the hull, paint pails hanging from hooks, brush dancing in his hand like it knew where to go without being told.
“What are you painting this time?” Mosby called.
“Eyes,” Manny replied without looking down. “Ship needs eyes. Needs to see, bring you back safe.”
Mosby sighed.
He never understood the need to paint nearly every vehicle on the islands in an explosion of color and style. At first he’d tried to persuade Manny not to touch the ship. He’d been politely ignored.
The explanation never changed.
“The ship,” Manny had said once, tapping the hull affectionately, “she has a home now. And we want her know she belongs.”
Mosby leaned back in his chair, fishing line still drifting, beer warming in his hand, and let the breeze pass through the open bay.
For now, that was enough.
A bottle later, Manny had changed sides and was nearly finished.
The hull looked louder now—eyes complete, lines sharpened, a few last strokes added where Manny felt the ship still needed them. He was rinsing a brush when the sound reached them: engines, low and deliberate, coming along the pier.
Mosby noticed immediately.
Most people didn’t drive this way. They walked along the beach instead—shorter, easier, and cooler underfoot. Vehicles meant purpose. Vehicles meant outsiders.
Manny didn’t look up.
“People come see you,” he said in the local pidgin, voice casual. “They arrive spaceport yesterday. Stay government house last night.”
Mosby frowned slightly and took another drink. The bottle was nearly three-quarters gone now.
He considered who would travel all the way out here to see him—and why Manny, of all people, would know about it.
“What do they want with me?” Mosby asked.
Manny climbed down the ladder, joints popping, and began sealing the paint cans with practiced care.
“Not for me say,” he replied.
He slung the cans into a netted carrier and started up the beach toward his house without another word.
Mosby watched him go.
He had no doubt the old man knew exactly who they were and why they’d come. There wasn’t much that happened on the islands that didn’t pass through Manny’s ears sooner or later. The locals treated him with a careful respect, half affection, half superstition—like a man who listened more than he spoke and remembered everything.
Mosby leaned back in his chair, eyes drifting toward the far end of the pier where the sound of the vehicles was growing clearer. He set the empty bottle beside the cooler and reached for another without opening it yet.
The breeze still moved through Farther Star’s open bay.
But the quiet had started to thin.
Two vehicles stopped where the road ended and gravel gave way to sand.
Six people got out.
Two were local police—uniforms faded by sun and salt, posture relaxed but alert. Two more had the look and bearing that announced agency security: neutral clothing, deliberate movements, eyes that never quite stopped working.
One of the remaining two was a woman.
But it was the last man who caught—and held—Mosby’s attention.
Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Korrin.
No uniform. No visible authority. And yet he stood there for a moment, motionless, as if he were about to dress down some young marine who’d failed to stand at attention. His gaze swept the scene methodically: Mosby in the chair, the beer, the fishing pole. Then it reached the ship.
It stopped there.
A visible grimace crossed Korrin’s face.
He turned to one of the security men and took a folder from him, flipping it open without breaking stride. Satisfied, he closed it as he started across the sand toward the pier, walking with the clipped, purposeful pace of a man who expected the ground to cooperate. The woman followed a step behind him.
Mosby noticed immediately that she wasn’t bothered by the Star’s appearance. Her eyes moved differently—taking in details instead of reacting to them. The hull, the open ramps, the breeze moving through the bay. Then him. Then the breakwater. Then the ocean beyond.
She looked human.
But something about her didn’t quite settle.
Before Mosby could place it, they reached the pier and stopped a few meters away.
“Captain Caleb Mosby,” Korrin said, his voice flat, the words clipped like he was biting back something sharper.
Mosby didn’t stand.
“Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Korrin,” he replied, equally flat, not bothering to acknowledge the woman with him. He let the title hang there—outdated and deliberate.
Korrin’s jaw tightened. “I have an assignment for you—”
“No,” Mosby said, cutting him off without raising his voice. “I’m not in your unit anymore. You don’t get to order me around.”
Korrin’s eyes flicked briefly to the Star, then back.
Mosby turned his head and met his gaze. “I’m out. That’s what discharged means.”
Korrin’s expression tightened, the color rising in his face despite his effort to contain it.
Before he could speak, the woman stepped forward.
The movement was unhurried, precise, placing her just enough between them to change the shape of the moment without challenging it.
“We’re not asking you to enlist,” she said calmly, a faint, practiced smile touching her lips. “Just to fly.”
“It’s never that simple, is it, Colonel,” Mosby said coldly. “It wasn’t then, and it isn’t now. So why me? And why now?”
“We need someone who can fly into places others can’t,” Korrin said. “And a ship that can get there.”
His mouth tightened.
“And,” he said, “because I don’t like you.”
The woman did not react to Korrin’s admission. If anything, she looked faintly relieved that it had been said aloud.
“That’s not the whole of it,” she said smoothly, before Mosby could respond. “But it’s close enough to be honest.”
Korrin shot her a sharp look. She ignored it.
She turned her attention fully to Mosby then, posture open without being casual, hands folded loosely in front of her as if this were a conversation she’d been expecting to have all along.
“You have a ship that can enter contested space without announcing itself,” she continued. “You have clearance histories that still resolve in the gate system, even if they shouldn’t. And you have experience flying without support, without oversight, and without the expectation that anyone is coming to help you if things go wrong.”
Mosby listened without comment.
“And,” she added, “you are here.”
Korrin folded his arms. “Don’t flatter him.”
“I’m not,” she said, still looking at Mosby. “I’m explaining why this didn’t go to a committee.”
She took a step closer, close enough now that Mosby could see the faint lines at the corners of her eyes—not age, exactly, but use. The look of someone who watched people decide things that mattered.
“We’re not asking you to rejoin anything,” she said again. “No uniform. No command structure. No flag on your hull.”
Korrin exhaled through his nose. “For now.”
She didn’t contradict him.
“What we’re asking,” she went on, “is that you take the Star somewhere we cannot officially go, and come back with what you find. Or who.”
Mosby’s gaze drifted past her—to the ship. To the paint drying on the hull. To the open ramps and the breeze moving through the bay like it always had.
“And if I say no?” he asked.
“You don’t,” Korrin snapped. The restraint finally broke. “You can be recalled to service and ordered.”
Mosby didn’t move.
“And your ship,” Korrin went on, the words sharpening into something personal. “How you got it. Why it was released. All of that can be reviewed.” He sneered, gesturing toward the riot of color on the hull. “Government property reclaimed. Frankly, it’d be cheaper to scrap it than try to strip all that off.”
“You try that,” Mosby said calmly, “and half your paperwork eats the other half. The rest gets buried so deep no one admits it ever existed.”
For a moment, neither of them spoke.
Korrin’s expression shifted—not rage, not surprise. Recognition. The look of a man reminded that some things had never gone the way he’d planned.
“You always did think you knew better,” Korrin said quietly.
Mosby met his eyes. “I did.”
The woman stepped forward before Korrin could push it further, her movement smooth, unhurried. She gave Korrin a look—measured, warning, final. He stopped.
“Things don’t have to be adversarial,” she said evenly. “If you say no, you remain free.”
She let that settle.
“It will simply take more effort to stay that way. Licenses take longer. Fuel costs more. Gate access stops resolving cleanly. Nothing dramatic. Nothing you could point to.”
She met Mosby’s eyes and held them.
Mosby smiled faintly.
“That’s what you call not ordering me around,” he said.
She inclined her head, acknowledging the point. “It’s what I call telling you the shape of the world you’re already in.”
Mosby studied her for a long moment.
“You are worse than that bastard.”
There was a twitch at the corner of her mouth when he said it.
The words weren’t loud. There was no heat in them. Just fatigue, and something old that had finally been allowed to surface.
For the first time since she’d stepped onto the pier, she didn’t answer immediately. She turned her gaze to the ocean and let it sit there—long enough to feel deliberate, not evasive.
“Can I have a moment alone with Mr. Mosby,” she said at last, holding her hand out without looking at Korrin.
The request was polite. The gesture wasn’t.
Korrin hesitated, the folder still in his hand. For a moment it looked like he might argue, might reclaim ground he’d already lost. Then his jaw tightened and he handed it to her instead.
She took it, didn’t open it, and tucked it under her arm.
“Wait by the vehicles,” she added.
Korrin turned away without a word. The security men followed, boots crunching softly as they moved back toward the road. The local police drifted off as well, leaving the pier to the sound of water and wind again.
Only then did Mosby really look at her.
She was tall, though not in a way that demanded notice. Long lines, balanced proportions, everything about her arranged for efficiency rather than display. She stood easily in the heat, weight centered, posture relaxed without ever becoming loose. Not Solarian drill. Something quieter. More ingrained.
Her features were fine-boned and even, skin smooth and unmarked by sun or scar. The humidity hadn’t touched her the way it touched everyone else on the pier. Her hair was pulled back simply, dark and glossy, held in place without ornament. No jewelry. No visible tech. Nothing unnecessary.
Her eyes met his.
They were dark and steady, attentive without pressing. She didn’t stare. She observed, letting the moment come to her. When she looked at Mosby, it wasn’t curiosity or judgment. It was assessment—complete and unhurried.
She looked human.
She just didn’t look Solarian.
“But he’s not wrong about one thing,” she said. “This situation exists whether you participate or not.”
Mosby nodded once.
“Who are you?” he asked.
She reached down, opened the folder, and slid a single sheet free. Not credentials. Not orders. A travel authorization, already populated. She set it on the crate between them and turned it so he could read it.
“My name is Sael,” she said. “And I’ll be going with you.”
“That wasn’t the question,” Mosby said.
“It’s the part that matters,” Sael replied. “Names are only useful when someone has to share space with you.”
Mosby glanced at the page, then back at her. “You don’t look like cargo.”
“I’m not,” she said. “I’m there to make sure this doesn’t become something it shouldn’t.”
Mosby got up out of the chair, reaching for the folder.
“Let me see what this is all about.”
She didn’t hand it to him.
She watched him for a moment, measuring something that had nothing to do with the paper. Then she closed the folder and tucked it back under her arm.
For a heartbeat, that seemed final.
“All right,” she said.
She handed it to him.
“I’ll be back this evening,” she added. “After you’ve looked things over and thought about it.”
She turned and walked back toward the vehicles without waiting for a reply. Korrin was already there, rigid beside the transport, eyes fixed anywhere but the pier. Doors closed. Engines started. Gravel crunched as the vehicles rolled away and disappeared beyond the rise.
Mosby stood on the pier with the folder in his hand, the Star breathing behind him, the paint on her hull still drying in the sun.
A bit later, Manny came back.
He went straight to the ladder where it already leaned against the Star’s forward flank and climbed the rungs, stopping to look over the hull. He tilted his head slightly, not searching, just taking it in.
Mosby watched from the chair, the folder still unopened on his knee.
Manny rested his hand on the metal near one of the newly painted eyes. The paint was still tacky. He left his hand there a moment longer than necessary. His lips moved, the sound too soft to make out—words without shape, carried more by habit than intent.
He drew his hand back.
“They coming back,” Manny said 
“Yes,” Mosby said.
Manny nodded once. “You going with them?” he asked.
Mosby glanced at the folder, then back at the ship. “I don’t know yet. Don’t know I have choice.”
Manny accepted that without comment.
“She got eyes now. That helps,” he said finally, as he gathered his things and started back toward town, unhurried.
Mosby didn’t open the folder right away.


As the afternoon wore on, Mosby read the dossier in the folder and read it again.
It was thin. Almost insultingly so.
Fly to the Ael-Runn system.
Wait.
Then return.
No contingencies. No timelines beyond soon. No explanation of what was being waited for.
The problem wasn’t the instructions.
The problem was Ael-Runn.
The system lay inside the Astraum Protectorate, and the Protectorate had never been subtle about who it tolerated in its space. Officially neutral, culturally rigid, and fiercely territorial, they were known for treating uninvited traffic as a philosophical failing rather than a navigational error.
Most of their citizens were not fanatics—at least not in the way Solaria defined the word—but they were deeply steeped in the Luminoti. Belief there wasn’t ornamental. It was structural.
That alone would have made the job delicate.
That the last war had been fought between Solaria and Thalean forces on one side and Astraum and its allies on the other made it something else entirely.
As he considered his options, Mosby realized he hadn’t eaten yet that day. Judging by the angle of the sun lowering toward the water, he could expect company soon as well.
With a sigh, he set the folder aside and pulled out a small grill. After a moment’s hesitation, he added a narrow table and two chairs.
As the sun touched the ocean and the local prawns neared the end of their time on the grill, Mosby heard footsteps on the rear ramp.
He didn’t turn.
Sael came up into the cargo bay with an easy, unhurried grace, as if the ship had already agreed to her presence. She paused just inside, her attention drawn to the built-in equipment racks along the bulkhead—scarred mounts, lock points polished by use, the quiet geometry of things meant to survive hard landings.
Then she continued forward, passing through the bay and out onto the pier-side opening.
“I didn’t hear you drive up,” Mosby observed.
“I walked down the beach, I don’t get to enjoy the sites often.  That smells good,” she said. “I didn’t know you could cook.”
Mosby flipped one of the prawns, watching the shell darken and split.
“Ship rations get old after a while,” he said. “So I learned to cook whatever the local economy has to offer.” He turned the next one with practiced care. “And folks in town can’t always pay in credits. I take trade—whatever they can spare.”
“They rely on you, then,” Sael said.
“Not too many traders come this way,” Mosby replied. “I run a regular route every month—Aureline, Kallamar, Paralax, a few nearby systems.” He began transferring the prawns to a plate. “It doesn’t make much more than fuel and maintenance, but I don’t need much more.”
He set the plate down, steam rising in the cooling air.
“It helps people out. Brings in medicine, mail. Things we don’t have locally.”
Sael studied him for a moment. Not his face—his hands, the way he moved, the way the ship sat open behind him.
“Mind if I sit?” she asked.
“Go ahead,” Mosby said, placing the plate at the center of the table. “Have you eaten?”
“I had something in town,” she said, taking the chair. “But it wasn’t as good as this smells.”
“Hang on,” Mosby said.
He disappeared into the ship and returned a moment later with another plate, a bottle of wine, and two glasses.
“You’ve had time to read the dossier,” she said, as he poured the wine and handed her a glass.
“I did.”
Mosby sat and served a portion onto each plate. The prawns steamed faintly in the cooling air. He didn’t rush to eat.  After a moment, he went on. “There wasn’t much to it. We leave here, head to the Ael-Ruun system, land, wait while you do whatever it is you’re there to do, then come back.” He glanced at her over the rim of his glass. “If that’s really all there is, you could’ve booked passage on a commercial liner. Would’ve been cheaper. Quieter, too.”
Sael took a sip of wine and held the glass for a moment before setting it down. She studied him—not weighing the words, but the way he’d chosen them.
“You know it isn’t that simple,” she said.
Mosby gave a short, humorless snort. “Yeah. I do.” He leaned back slightly in his chair. “And it’s going to be rougher than you’re letting on.”
She didn’t interrupt.
“Ael-Ruun sits inside the Protectorate,” he continued. “They’re touchy about who comes into their space on a good day. After the war?” He shook his head. “They don’t see outsiders as visitors. They see them as problems.”
He finally picked up his fork, more out of habit than appetite.
“And that’s before you factor in the Luminoti.”
Sael’s expression didn’t change—but something behind her eyes did.  Finally she admitted it. 
“Of course,” Sael said. “That’s why you’re flying me in.”
She took a bite, then paused. Her expression shifted—not surprise, but genuine pleasure.
“Oh,” she said quietly. “This is good.”
She ate another bite before continuing, as if the food had earned her patience.
“You flew into worse places during the war,” she went on. “I read your file. Even the classified parts.” She met his eyes over the rim of her glass. “At least no one is shooting at you this time.”
Mosby set his fork down.
The sound was soft, deliberate.
“We won’t have a team of operators backing us up either,” he said. “No overwatch. No extraction window. Just you, me, and the Star.”
Sael didn’t interrupt. That was telling.
“I can fly her,” Mosby continued. “I can keep us out of trouble most days. But if this goes sideways—and it will—I’m going to need someone who can keep the ship working while I’m busy doing something else.”
He watched her carefully now.
“Engineering,” he [TM1]said. “And it wouldn’t hurt if they knew how to move in places where questions come with consequences.”
He let that sit between them.
Sael took another bite, slower this time. Thoughtful.
“You already have someone in mind,” she said.
Mosby didn’t answer right away. He picked up his glass, took a sip, then nodded once.
“An old contact,” he said. “Not Solarian. Not Astraeum either. Knows how to fix things that were never meant to break—and people who know things they shouldn’t.”
She studied him for a long moment.
“A Talarian,” she said finally, a faint crease forming between her brows.
She took another drink, then rolled the wine slowly in her glass, watching the light catch in it.
“All right,” she said. “Anything else?”
Mosby didn’t answer right away. He finished his food, set the fork down carefully, and wiped his hands on a cloth that had seen better days.
“Yeah,” he said. “It’s a long run, even if we don’t miss a gate. Transit fees. Fuel. Maintenance. Supplies.” He ticked them off without looking at her. “I’ll be gone longer than a casual job. I’ll need time to line someone up to run my route while I’m out. I’m not leaving people here without medicine or mail because you showed up with a folder.”
She nodded once, accepting that without comment.
“I want two hundred thousand credits,” Mosby went on. “Half up front. And another hundred thousand to cover the Talarian.”
Sael didn’t blink.
She set her glass down, reached into her jacket, and extended her hand across the table.
“Agreed.”
The word landed too quickly. Too cleanly.
Mosby didn’t take her hand.
“You didn’t even ask why,” he said.
“I don’t need to,” she replied. “That number tells me how dangerous you think this is. And how much you’re willing to tolerate being lied to.”
That earned a faint, humorless breath from him.
“You’re not even pretending this is a negotiation.”
She met his eyes. “You weren’t pretending either.”
For a moment they sat there, the sound of the water below the pier filling the space between them. Somewhere behind them, the Star’s cooling systems ticked softly as metal adjusted to the evening air.
Finally, Mosby took her hand.
Her grip was firm. Not dominant. Not tentative. Just certain.
The rest of the evening passed with charts spread across the table and the last of the wine going warm in their glasses.
Sael preferred the gate routes—clean, predictable, officially sanctioned.
Mosby shook his head.
“That’s the obvious way,” he said, tapping the display and pushing it aside. “Which means it’s watched.”
He brought up a secondary map, older and less refined, dotted with systems most traffic ignored.
“We come in from here,” he said, indicating a nearby star off the main routes. “No gates leading in. Local patrols will be concentrated on the other side of the system. We ride the gravity wells—use the gas giants to mask our approach.”
Sael leaned closer, studying the geometry. “They’ll still have sensors.”
“They’ll have expectations,” Mosby replied. “That’s not the same thing.”
She glanced up at him.
“Assault shuttles were stealthy by design,” he continued. “The Iron Fall class especially. Low-emission hulls, baffled drives, sensor profiles meant to look like debris if you didn’t know what you were looking for.” He paused. “With the right pilot.”
Sael’s eyes flicked briefly toward the open bay, to the painted hull and the shadows crawling across it as night set in.
“The Farther Star is a Black Iron,” Mosby said. “Outfitted for insertion with even more advanced stealth and  passive electronic warfare systems. Sit quiet. Wait. Leave without anyone ever being sure we were there. They were slated to be scrapped after the war.”
Sael leaned back slightly.
“Korrin knew this,” she said.
It wasn’t a question.
Mosby didn’t answer immediately. He adjusted the chart, rotated it a few degrees, then finally nodded once.
“Yeah,” he said. “He did.”
That settled between them heavier than any plotted trajectory.
Sael looked back at the charts, but her focus had shifted. Not routes now—motives.
“Which means,” she said carefully, “this wasn’t about finding a pilot.”
“No,” Mosby said. “It was about finding me.”
For the first time that evening, her expression tightened—not surprise, but confirmation.
“All right,” she said at last. “When do we leave?”
“Two or three days,” Mosby replied. “I need time to send a few messages and wait for the answers. In the meantime, I’ll prep the Star. Load provisions. Cargo.”
Sael raised an eyebrow. “Cargo?”
“An empty trader draws attention,” Mosby said. “Cargo looks legitimate. And a few extra credits never hurt.”
She considered that, then nodded once. “All right.”
She stood, glancing out toward the water where the waves struck the pier in a steady, patient rhythm. Gathering her things, she turned back to him.
“It’s late,” she said. “And it looks like we’ll both be busy. I’ll head back to the government house. Leave word there when you’re ready.”
Mosby watched her step away, then asked, “You going to be all right walking back alone?”
She paused, just long enough to look over her shoulder and a brief, predatory smile touched her lips.
“I don’t think there’s anything out here,” she said, “that I can’t handle.”
Then she turned and walked off into the darkening evening, leaving Mosby alone with the charts, the ship, and the sound of the sea.

The next two days started early. When the Relay office opened, messages were sent to traders Mosby knew and trusted. It would take at least a day before any replies came back. After that he arranged for cargo to be ready for loading in two days’ time, then returned to the Star, moving through her methodically, securing anything loose that might rattle free under hard thrust. The afternoon and the next day were spent checking and double-checking every system: power relays, cooling loops, hull seams along the forward flanks where Black Irons always took stress on violent entries. He worked with a light clamped between his teeth more often than not, collecting minor cuts on each hand and grease up to his elbows as he pulled open maintenance hatches that hadn’t been touched in months.
Sael appeared at some point without announcement. He found her in the forward systems bay, sleeves rolled, diagnostic slate open, quietly recalibrating a sensor cluster that had been drifting off true for longer than he liked to admit.
“You don’t have to do that,” he said, leaning against the hatch frame.
“It was wrong,” she replied without looking up. “If I’m risking my life in this ship, I want it right.”
He watched a moment longer, then nodded once and moved on.
The next morning, when the haulers arrived with the cargo, she took charge of the loading without asking permission. Most of it was seafood packed in insulated crates and a small amount of local produce bound for markets farther along Mosby’s usual route. She moved with care, balancing weight across the bay without being told how, knowing instinctively not to stack anything where it might shift under lateral thrust. When she noticed Mosby watching, she said simply, “I worked logistics. Started as a loader and moved up from there before getting into government work.” Mosby shrugged, accepting the explanation, and let her continue.
By noon most of the cargo had been secured. As the last hauler pulled away down the beach road, Manny came walking along the sand, trousers rolled, hat in hand, as if this were any other day. He carried a small envelope pouch tucked under his arm. Inside were printed relay texts — the replies to the messages Mosby had sent the morning before. Short, practical ones. A woman on Aureline who owed him a favor. A retired courier on Kallamar who still liked to feel useful. Each had agreed to cover the route Mosby normally ran until he returned.
After reading them, Mosby handed the messages back to Manny. “Things’ll be fine till I get back,” he said. “Jacobson might overcharge a bit, but I can cover that later.”
“Town good to know,” Manny said, eyes moving over the ship, taking in the change in her usual relaxed, open feel. Then he brought out what he’d been carrying in his other hand: a necklace of bright braided cord strung with small shells and a carved turtle of dark driftwood, worn smooth from handling. Without ceremony, Manny slipped it over Mosby’s head and let it settle against his chest.
“What’s this for?” Mosby asked, lifting the turtle to examine it.
Manny shrugged. “For the journey. Turtle knows. Comes back to the same shore.” He nodded once toward the ship. “Figure you should too.”
He didn’t wait for thanks. He simply turned and started back toward town.
“Hey,” Mosby called after him, “how do you know about turtles? Terraformers haven’t brought any in yet!”
Manny raised a hand without looking back. “Don’t need to see them,” he called. “I know.”

Sael was tightening a strap when Mosby walked up the aft ramp.
“We good to go?” he asked.
“Last one.”
“Got all your gear?”
She pointed at a pile of bags and cases. “Everything I need.”
“Fine. You have the copilot’s bunk. Stow your gear there. Any firearms go in the weapons locker.” Mosby said, pressing the controls to close the aft ramp and its clamshell doors.
“Why is that?” she asked.
“My ship, my rules.” He gave her a level look. “I don’t want anything loose that could be trouble once we’re underway. You don’t like it, we can call this off right now.”
Sael paused, clearly not pleased, then relented. “Fine. But I want the access code.”
“I figured as much,” Mosby said, walking past her toward the forward ramp.

Twenty minutes later Mosby was in the cockpit, running through preflight, when Sael entered and took the copilot’s seat.
“Are we ready?” she asked, fastening her harness.
“Just about,” Mosby answered, working through the last items on the checklist. He keyed the transmitter.
“Brightwater Port Control, trader vessel Farther Star, requesting flight plan activation.”
A moment passed before an out-of-breath voice replied, “Farther Star, Brightwater Control, go ahead.”
Mosby flipped switches and checked readouts. The ship began to hum, then the twin engines deepened into a low, gathering growl. It felt as if the Farther Star were bracing herself to leap off the pier.
“Filed outbound to Aureline via direct burn. Two souls aboard, cargo secured. Request plan activation and departure clearance.”
Sael raised an eyebrow. “Being a bit officious, aren’t you?”
“They don’t get much traffic,” Mosby said. “Makes ’em feel important. Keeps me in practice too.”
The voice returned. “Plan activated at 13:12 local. No other departures scheduled. You’re clear whenever ready, Mosby.”
“Brightwater Traffic, Farther Star lifting in two minutes.”
“Copy that. Surface corridor clear. Winds light out of the west. You mind if my cousin uses your pier while you’re gone?”
Mosby laughed softly. “Sure. Tell him just don’t scuff anything.”
“No promises,” the voice replied.
Mosby increased power, and the Farther Star lifted fast and clean, rising off the pier in a column of shimmering heat. The water below flattened under the thrust wash as the ship clawed upward, climbing hard into the afternoon sky.
Blue faded to indigo, then to a deepening violet. Within minutes the horizon curved, clouds thinning beneath them like torn gauze. The vibration changed pitch as the atmosphere fought back.
Sael sat rigid in the copilot’s seat, fingers locked around the armrests as the hull shuddered through a pocket of rough air.
“You all right?” Mosby asked without looking at her, eyes on his instruments.
She nodded once, too quickly. “Not used to this much turbulence.”
Mosby’s mouth twitched. “Lady, you ain’t seen nothing yet.”
Her head snapped toward him, eyes wide.
His grin widened just a little.
“Brightwater Traffic, Farther Star passing six-zero thousand meters, transitioning to orbital climb,” Mosby transmitted.
A moment later the reply crackled through. “Logged, Farther Star. Safe flight, Mosby. Relay office will forward any messages.”


Clearing the planet’s gravity well took longer than most people would expect, and Mosby wasn’t pushing the engines hard. Their power came as a steady vibration through the ship—a low tremor in the deck and up through the seat frame. The climb was deliberate, efficient and unhurried, wasting no fuel as the Farther Star curved away and the planet fell behind.
Sael said little during ascent. Her hands stayed on the armrests, though the death grip she’d started with had eased. As violet faded to black and the world slipped out of view, she settled back and took several slow breaths.
“You okay?” Mosby asked, adjusting course, his hands moving easily across the controls.
“I…” She grimaced. “That felt rougher than I’m used to.”
“You’re used to civilian craft. They run heavier stabilizers and dampeners than what the Star was built with,” he said. “I should apologize, though. Assault pilots turn the dampeners down to get a better feel for the ship going in on a run. It rides rougher, but that’s what I’m used to.” He glanced over at her, sincere. “I’ll reset them to full next time.”
Sael closed her eyes and let out a slow breath. “No… I’ll manage. You do what you need to get us there.”
Two hours later Mosby began the FTL checklist, eyes moving across displays and instruments as his hands worked the controls by habit. Sael had relaxed once they were clear of the planet; she returned from the galley with two mugs and offered one across the console.
“Coffee?”
“Oh, no thanks,” Mosby said. “Four and a half years in the Marines and I never could get used to the nasty stuff.”
Sael settled into the co-pilot’s seat, cupping the mug in both hands. “It doesn’t grow on Astrin, and we couldn’t afford it anyway.” She took a sip, closing her eyes briefly as she savored the taste. “I learned to like it working logistics on a station in Orenai.”
“Orenai?” Mosby glanced over at her. “That’s Solerain.”
Sael lowered the mug to her lap, still holding it, a small frown crossing her face. “I’m the fourth daughter of a minor house. There wasn’t much prospect for me, so I took a government post. They assigned me to Orenai as a logistics liaison.”
“So you were a Lady stacking boxes,” Mosby observed wryly, continuing down the checklist.
“Yes,” she said, straightening in her seat, chin lifting a fraction. “But it got me to where I am now — and where I will be soon.”
Mosby paused at that, one hand resting lightly on the console. Then he said, as if nothing of weight had just been spoken, “Well, do you mind checking the cargo before we go to FTL?”
Sael studied him for a moment, then her expression softened. “Certainly.” She set the mug into its holder, unstrapped, and rose, moving aft without another word.
Mosby watched her go, gave a small shake of his head, and turned back to the instruments. He waited until she returned.
“All good?”
“Everything secure,” she said, settling into her seat. “But the ship’s going to smell like fish soon.”
He sighed. “Can’t be helped. Not much else comes off Brightwater until the harvest comes in. I’ll get new filters at Aureline Transit, but it’ll linger for a month. All right — let’s go to FTL.”
Sael sat back and began tightening her straps as far as they would go. Mosby noticed.
“Don’t overdo it,” he said. “This won’t be like leaving atmo. This’ll be… different. Smooth, but different.”
She looked relieved. “I’ve been through jumps before, but always in liners or cargo haulers. I’m a rated pilot, you know. Those ships flew almost entirely by instruments.” She gestured toward the forward ports. “You couldn’t see a thing outside.”
Mosby did the final checks, confirmed no contacts on the sensors, then leaned back. “Okay… here we go.”
The FTL drive began to spool up, and the ship filled with a low, steady hum. Mosby eased the power forward.
The world outside changed.
FTL wasn’t a flash, or a jump, or streaking stars. Instead, space ahead of them softened, like heat haze over a desert road. A faint shimmer gathered before the bow, then spread, blooming outward until it swallowed the view and even the Farther Star seemed dim beside it.
Outside, the universe stretched.
Stars did not streak — they smeared into impossible geometries, long, curved distortions like light seen through rippling water. Shapes lingered at the edge of perception: threads, arcs, deep wells of shadow that seemed to slide past without ever quite moving.
Inside, a low harmonic vibration filled the ship, not loud, but present everywhere at once. Now and then there was the subtle sensation of turning, though no thrusters fired and no course change showed on the board.
Sael exhaled slowly. “It looks different than I expected. It feels like we’re inside something,” she said, quiet with awe.
“We are,” Mosby replied. “Just don’t ask me to explain what.”
After that there was little to do once the navigation computer took over. Mosby stayed near the cockpit, dozing in the pilot’s seat in short stretches, waking often to scan the instruments or when a subtle shift in the ship’s motion stirred him. When the second watch cycle would normally begin, Sael appeared in the cockpit doorway with food and two cups in her hands.
“You sleep like a man expecting problems,” she said, setting the food and one cup where he could reach them.
Mosby’s eyes opened partway as he looked at her. “I sleep like a man who’s had problems,” he replied. “Another old habit from flying alone so long. There isn’t anyone else.” He pushed himself upright, took the food, and began eating slowly. “Pretty good,” he added after a moment.
“Thanks.” Sael glanced over the instruments, checking their progress. “It isn’t good for you. You should get proper sleep. I can handle things, and you won’t be any use worn out if something happens.”
“Alright,” Mosby said, standing and stretching. After shoveling in another bite, he gestured toward the pilot’s seat. “Let’s see what you can do.”
Sael slid into the seat and began reviewing the displays. He stood behind her, eating, watching the way her hands moved over the controls—smooth inputs, no overcorrection, her eyes traveling steadily across the board without lingering too long on any one thing. He finished the meal and gave a small nod to himself.
“What do you think?” he asked.
“Transit’s faster than a hauler, but nothing I can’t handle. Not much to do, really.” She glanced back at him.
“Alright. Wake me if the drift exceeds point-zero-three,” he said, stepping out of the cockpit.
“It won’t,” she replied.
“That wasn’t a suggestion,” he growled.
She waited until he’d moved down the corridor. “I know,” she said softly, a small smile touching her face.

The next day passed as they developed a rhythm for ship life.  One of them in or near the cockpit.  Eating meal the one or the other cooked and the other cleaned.  Watches rotated and systems were checked and rechecked.  As Sael had said there was not much to do.
On the third day, a chiming alert began while Sael was on watch.  “FTL exit approach in twenty,” Sael said into the ships intercom. 

“I will be there in a minute,” was the reply.  Mosby strolled into the cockpit.  “How are things?”
“Everything is within parameters and ready for FTL exit.” she said starting to get out of the pilot seat.  
Mosby put a hand of her shoulder stopping her.  “You piloted an exit?”

“Once.. it was a while back.. it was mostly automated” she said hovering over the seat. 

“Well this is a quiet system and no better time to do it manually.” Mosby moved to the co-pilot seat.  
Sael sat backdown, took a deep breath, and began adjusting the controls.  Slowly space outside clarified by degrees. The stretched impressions of distant stars tightened back into points. A pale system primary bloomed ahead rushing at them.
“Easy,” Mosby murmured. “Don’t rush the transition.”
“I’m not,” she said.  “Sensors show no obstructions at the exit point.  
The field peeled away from the Star like water shedding from a hull. Normal space settled around them with a subtle shudder through the frame.
Sael let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.
“Welcome back to the slow universe,” Mosby said.
The navigation computer began to display the system’s traffic lanes, and the scanners showed only light traffic clustered around the two enormous glowing rings of the jump gates as they vectored toward the station. Civilian transponders pinged lazily across the system net—haulers, couriers, a bulk transport crawling in-system at sublight.
Routine.
Orderly.
Mosby keyed the comm.
“Aureline Traffic, independent trader Farther Star inbound from outer vector. Request approach corridor and docking assignment.”
“Farther Star, wait one at the outer marker.”
“Mosby,” Sael said, a note of concern in her voice, “transient return on the scope.”
“Where?” he said, leaning to get a better look.
She marked the vector, but it now showed empty space. “Sensor echo from the transition?” she asked, not sounding certain.
Mosby didn’t answer.
A second later the contact returned—closer this time, still outside visual range, profile too thin for a freighter, too steady for debris.
And matching their vector.
Mosby’s jaw tightened. “That’s not traffic.”
The contact shifted again, sliding just far enough off their sensor edge to make a clean lock impossible.
Sael’s voice stayed level, but her hands were very still on the controls. “It’s pacing us.”
“Yeah,” Mosby said quietly. “It is.”
He checked the sensors and the comm. No registry string. No trade ID. Just a clean, blank return where data ought to have been. He stiffened.
Sael noticed the change in his posture. “Problem?”
“Maybe nothing,” he said. “Got a ghost out there.”
He magnified the contact. The return was thin, almost too neat, like a shape cut out of space rather than built in it.
“Military?” she asked.
“Not broadcasting like one,” Mosby said. “Not broadcasting like anything.”
He keyed a polite, low-power ping on standard trader frequencies. “Unidentified traffic, this is independent trader Farther Star inbound from Brightwater. You showing passive only, or you got something to say?”
No response.
The contact held its course for several minutes more, then made a shallow burn adjustment. Not toward them. Not away. Just… sideways. As if stepping out of a line only it could see.
A minute later it disappeared from the scanner display, gone as cleanly as it had appeared.
Sael kept her eyes on the screen even after the marker vanished. “Could be a survey craft,” she said. “Or a courier running dark.”
“Could be,” Mosby agreed.
He didn’t add that survey craft filed notices, and couriers running dark didn’t drift that close to a known trade lane without saying hello.
“What do you think?” Sael asked, more quietly now.
“Don’t know,” Mosby said. “I’m just a pilot. This is more your world than mine.”
She watched him for a moment, calculating, lips pressed tight, then looked back at the scanner. “It’s probably nothing to worry about.”
Then the comm came to life. “Farther Star, Aureline Control. You’re cleared Dock Ring C, Berth Twelve. Vector two-seven-eight mark zero-zero-three. Watch your drift—we’ve got a tanker cycling thrusters on the inner lane.”
“Copy that,” Mosby said, switching seats with Sael.
He made the course corrections smoothly and guided the Star through the traffic lanes. Small adjustments brought them into alignment with the berth. A soft shudder ran through the hull as the docking clamps took hold. Mosby powered down the engines and let the station’s handling system ease the Star the rest of the way in.
Sael watched as he completed the docking sequence. “You make that look easy.”
“It is,” he said. “Right up until it isn’t.”

The smell hit the dock workers before the ramp finished lowering.
One of them laughed. “Brightwater catch again?”
“Fresh this time,” Mosby said. “Mostly.”
They worked fast. Crates of insulated seafood came off first, followed by small bins of island produce. Payment transferred in small, practical numbers—not enough to make anyone rich, but enough to keep routes alive.
Sael handled the manifests without being asked, cross-checking weights and signatures while Mosby argued mildly with a quartermaster about the spoilage during transit.
By the time the last crate was offloaded, the cargo bay already held new freight: machine parts, medical supplies, sealed containers marked for Karamar and further along the line.
Routine. Ordinary. Safe.
Which made Mosby more uneasy than he liked. That other ship still sat wrong with him. He did not like being in the dark.

Inside the station, gravity felt wrong after three days under thrust. Sael adjusted quickly. Mosby didn’t bother trying to hide the way he compensated.
They stopped first at the relay office.
The clerk barely looked up. “Name?”
“Mosby. Trader.”
She slid a thin stack of printed slips across the counter. “Three inbound. Two pending transmission confirmation.”
Short notes. Route confirmations. A polite complaint about a pickup delay Mosby would have to smooth over later. If later came, he reminded himself.
Nothing else.
Sael watched him read. “You were expecting something?”
“Not really,” he said, folding the slips.

They ate in a dockside galley that specialized in food meant to remind travelers of somewhere else.
Sael tried a local stew and decided it was attempting three cuisines at once. Mosby stuck with bread, roasted meat, and something that claimed to be beer.
“Next stop is Kalamar,” he said. “Then New Horizon. Traffic will be heavier there. Good place to disappear in a crowd.”
“Is that possible in the Star, the way she’s painted?” Sael asked lightly.
He gave her a sour look.
She met his eyes. “You think we’re being followed.”
“I think something took an interest,” he said. “That’s not the same thing. Yet.”
She didn’t push further.

Departure from Aureline was clean. Gate traffic was steady but orderly, a line of ships spaced like beads on a wire.
Sael watched the gate approach closely.
The structure filled the forward ports—a vast engineered ring of light and field geometry suspended between gravitic pylons. Energy crawled across its inner surface in layered bands, like currents moving through glass. Ships entered one at a time, vanished in a soft distortion, and were gone.
“First time through a major gate from the front seat?” Mosby asked.
“I’ve used them,” she said. “Never from up here.”
“Then don’t blink.”
Their turn came. Mosby eased the Star forward, matching the velocity envelope.
The ship crossed the threshold—
—and the stars vanished.
They were inside a tunnel of structured light, the walls flowing past in rippling bands of color and geometry that never quite repeated. The sensation wasn’t of jumping, but of being carried—locked into a current that tolerated no deviation.
Sael gripped the armrests. “I thought it would be… more dramatic.”
“Be glad it isn’t,” Mosby said.
Instead of the contained bubble of FTL, gate transit felt like riding inside an engineered current. Ahead, faint and distant, another ship held the same lane—its navigation lights a steady glow.
To their right, something flashed.
A streak of blue-white light tore past in the adjacent transit lane, Doppler-shifted into a hard ultraviolet glare that vanished before her brain could make sense of it.
Sael blinked. “What was that?”
“Somebody in a hotter lane,” Mosby said. “Different mass profile, different speed. They’re gone before we really see them.”
The Star hummed steadily, locked into the gate’s flow. This time there was even less to do than in FTL. The navigation computer didn’t correct or adjust. It simply held them in the stream.  It would take 15 days to complete the transit.  Time was filled by changing out the life support filters and other minor maintenance tasks.  
On the fourteenth day, while they both sat in the cockpit watching the slow drift of light beyond the forward ports, Sael asked quietly, “What is it between you and Korrin? Why do you hate each other so much?”
Mosby didn’t answer right away. His eyes stayed on the instruments.
“I started out as just another assault pilot for the Marines,” he said at last. “We were on one of those planets I can’t even remember the name of anymore, flying evac. One of our battalions got cut off in a mountain valley. The Wards had the area thick with anti-air, and our people were getting picked off trying to move the wounded.”
He shifted slightly in his seat, as if something old still ached.
“I went in low and as fast as I could push the shuttle. Took fire on the way down, but I got the first load out. They were all in bad shape. I went back again, but the shuttle had problems and hit hard on landing. I swapped birds and went back in.”
He paused.
“I made three more runs. Lost two more shuttles. Last time in, I had shrapnel in my side and didn’t know it. Collapsed after we got clear.”
“Sounds bad,” she said.
Mosby nodded. “We did what we had to. Most didn’t make it out, though.” He paused, looking out through the forward port. “When I got out of the hospital, I’d been transferred. Korrin was CO of a special operations unit. Wanted me specifically because I’d been crazy enough—and good enough—for the kind of missions he was handing out.”
“I didn’t like being pulled off evac for covert ops that seemed pointless at the time,” Mosby said. “Though I did get to fly the Star.”
“You flew this ship in the war?” Sael asked, surprised.
“Sure did. She was something then.” A faint smile touched his mouth, but it didn’t last. “Toward the end, the war was winding down. There was a team behind the contact line. Good people. I’d gotten them in and out of bad places more than once.”
He looked down at his hands for a moment.
“Korrin got orders to pull out. Evac the planet. The team didn’t make the list. Acceptable losses.”
Sael didn’t interrupt.
“I couldn’t do it,” Mosby said quietly. “I walked into the command hut, argued with him, and when that didn’t work…” He gave a small shrug. “I decked him.”
Her eyebrows rose.
“Took the Star and went back for them. By the time I got back, Korrin had pulled the unit out. We were left on the planet—me, the team, and a ship that wasn’t supposed to be there anymore.”
He looked out through the forward port.
“I got us into orbit, found a jump point, and got us out. Me, the Star, and the team.”
“Then what?” she asked.
“The war was over by the time we reached a friendly base,” Mosby said. “They were mustering everyone out as fast as they could. The depot I processed through was also a collection point. They were selling or scrapping shuttles just as fast.”
He glanced toward the bulkhead, as if he could see the Star through it.
“I got my mustering-out pay and saw her sitting in line for the torch. Couldn’t let that happen. I talked to the sergeant in charge, convinced him to mark her as surplus, and before anyone thought too hard about it… I was off-planet and gone.”
A faint, crooked smile tugged at his mouth.
“Found out later one of the guys on that team had a father in the Council. Didn’t care much for his son being written off as acceptable losses. That more or less ended Korrin’s chances at promotion in the regular service.”
He gave a small shrug.
“But your side of things isn’t so picky about bruised careers. He found a place with you spooks instead.”
Mosby was silent for a long moment. Sael watched him, studying the set of his shoulders, the way his gaze stayed fixed somewhere beyond the stars outside. None of that had been in the briefings.
“Well,” Mosby said at last, as if pushing the memory back where it belonged, “I need something to drink. You want anything?”
“No, thank you,” Sael replied.
He left the cockpit without another word.
It was his watch, she noticed. He never left the controls during his watch.
Sael settled back into the seat, hands resting lightly on the armrests. The man she had been assigned was not just a surplus pilot with a stubborn streak. He was someone who disobeyed orders when lives were on the line. Someone who hit a commanding officer and flew into a warzone alone.
That kind of person was not predictable.
That kind of person was not controllable.
She found, to her surprise, that this did not make her feel safer — or entirely uneasy.
The next day, late in the afternoon, Sael was in the cargo bay checking the restraints on the  pallets of containers when Mosby’s voice came over the intercom.
“We’re coming up on the exit. Everything good down there?”
“Everything’s good and tight,” she replied, giving one of the ratchet straps a final tug.
“Alright. You’ll want to get up here.”
Sael wiped her hands on a rag and headed for the gantry. She climbed to the second deck, boots ringing lightly on the metal steps, then moved through the corridor toward the cockpit. The ship hummed around her, the deep, steady vibration of gate transit threaded with a faint harmonic whine from the field systems.
She slid into the co-pilot’s seat. “Problems?”
“No problems, yet,” Mosby said with a sideways grin. “I’m guessing since you’ve never piloted entry into a gate, you’ve never piloted out.”
“No…” she admitted, fastening her harness a notch tighter.
“You’re in for a ride then.”
“What do you mean?”
Mosby gestured toward the forward displays. The gate corridor stretched ahead of them, a long, structured tunnel of shifting light. In their lane, a massive cargo hauler loomed in the distance, its running lights steady, hull broad and blocky. Even at this scale it looked less like a ship and more like a moving piece of infrastructure.
“Gates are built for the big boys — bulk cruisers, capital ships,” Mosby said. “They’ve got right of way. If we drift out of alignment — or someone behind us does — somebody ends up in the wrong lane, and that much mass can’t stop on a credit.”
Sael watched the hauler’s slow, implacable progress on the traffic overlay. “So we just… stay where we are?”
“No,” Mosby said. “Gate Control will kick us a departure vector any moment. When they do, we move. Out here, you don’t choose your path — you’re handed it.”
A soft chime sounded from the comm panel.
“Trader Farther Star, Gate Control. Your exit vector is zero six eight mark two eight four. Execute on threshold.”
Mosby keyed the mic. “Control, Farther Star. Zero six eight mark two eight four, on threshold.”
He glanced at Sael. “That’s us. Right and down.”
He brought the maneuvering systems fully online. The engines deepened to a waiting hum, power building through the frame without yet pushing the ship. Sael felt it in the seat — restrained strength held in check.
“We don’t move early,” Mosby said. “Inside the corridor, you stay where you’re told. Outside… you get out of the way fast.”
A small countdown appeared on the edge of the display, synced to the gate’s internal timing.
3
The tunnel ahead brightened, geometry tightening toward the exit flare.
2
Mosby’s hands rested lightly on the controls. Sael saw the stillness in him — not relaxation, but focus drawn tight.
1
“Hold on.”
The instant the Star crossed the threshold, Mosby drove the thrust forward and rolled the ship into the assigned vector. The corridor vanished in a flare of distorted light, replaced by the hard black of real space and the pale blaze of the system’s primary.
The ship kicked sideways and down relative to their original line of travel. Stars swung across the viewports in a smooth, stomach-turning arc.
“Fucking black—” Sael snapped, hands tightening on the armrests.
Mosby’s mouth twitched, but his eyes never left the board.
Traffic scattered across the system display — established lanes, steady velocities, masses already committed to their paths. For a few seconds the projections overlapped in a web of possible futures.
Then the lines separated.
They were in their slot.
Mosby eased the thrust back, letting the ship settle into the outbound corridor. The engines dropped to a steady cruise vibration.

“Didn’t think a Lady knew those kinds of words,” Mosby said casually.

Sael gave him a dirty look.  “Logistics bays and cargo ships are poor places for refinement,” she said. “You adapt.”

Mosby just nodded, a faint grin touching the corner of his mouth as his eyes stayed on the board. “Fair enough.”

Docking at Kalamar went much like Aureline had.
Cargo came off. Cargo went on. Money changed hands in quiet, practical amounts.
Mosby let Sael handle the manifests and the loading and unloading while he took care of provisioning and maintenance parts. By the time they cast off again, the Star smelled marginally less like fish and marginally more like machinery.
Another gate transit later, they entered the New Horizon system.
New Horizon Station announced itself first as noise — overlapping transponders, docking requests, yard-control chatter, and the constant hum of ships maneuvering in tight quarters. The station sprawled across the inner system like something that had grown rather than been built: rings added onto trusses, habitat drums bolted to cargo spines, fuel tanks clustered like barnacles.
Mosby studied the approach vector. “Home of honest traders, quiet deals, and people who don’t ask more than they need to.”
Sael glanced at the traffic overlay. “This is where we meet your… old contact.”
Mosby’s mouth twitched. “Yeah. It is.”

For two days they had been on the station.
Mosby spent them the same way he always did when he was looking for someone who didn’t want to be found — slowly, without asking questions that echoed. He moved through the merchants’ tiers, the cafés tucked into maintenance spines, the bars that didn’t advertise themselves except by the fact that the lighting never quite worked. He listened more than he spoke. Bought drinks he didn’t finish. Paid attention to who noticed him and who pretended not to.
Ted wasn’t the Talari’s name.
Mosby had learned that early on. The real name involved tonal shifts and timing he never quite managed, and the last time he’d tried it without the proper inflection, a dockside bar had gone from noisy to violent in the space of a heartbeat. A jukebox had died spectacularly. Bottles had broken. Three Talari longshoremen had taken mortal offense, a pair of off-duty Marines had decided it looked like their kind of problem, and Mosby and the Talari had ended up fighting back-to-back in the middle of it until station security waded in with stunners and very firm opinions about public order.
They’d spent the night in a holding cell while someone with a linguistics license sorted it out.
Mosby had been informed — very politely — that he’d said something between useful idiot and poorly assembled animal.
“Ted” had been agreed upon instead. Provisionally. With amusement.
By the second afternoon, Mosby had settled into a concourse near one of the station’s newer attractions — a sprawling, aggressively colorful display advertising luxury excursions that no one in this part of the station was ever going to take. The sound loop was slightly out of sync with the visuals. It made the whole thing faintly irritating, which kept people from lingering too long.
Mosby sat with his back to a support column, a cup of something bitter cooling in his hand, watching reflections slide across polished metal.
He felt the presence before he heard the voice.
“Friend Mosby,” it said, close and calm. “We again meet.”
Mosby didn’t turn right away. He took another sip, set the cup aside, then glanced over his shoulder.
The Talari stood just inside his peripheral vision, positioned where foot traffic naturally split around him. Tall and narrow, with long, fine-boned limbs and a stillness that looked chosen rather than natural. His skin bore faint ridges that caught the light like worn grain in old wood, and a fall of thin, corded tendrils lay braided back from his head, threaded with small beads and bits of worked metal that clicked softly when he moved.
His clothing was layered and practical — a weathered jacket reinforced at the shoulders and elbows, scarves and wraps crossing the chest, tools and small instruments hanging in quiet reach along straps and loops. Nothing decorative that didn’t also serve a purpose. Subtle markings traced the exposed skin of his neck and hands — scars, perhaps, or ornament. Mosby had learned not to ask.
A pair of station workers altered course without looking at him. Not avoidance — accommodation. Like stepping aside for someone carrying something fragile and potentially dangerous.
His eyes caught the light oddly, mineral hues shifting as his gaze adjusted, the aperture band narrowing with what Mosby had come to recognize as focus.
“You always say that like it’s a surprise,” Mosby said.
“It is,” the Talari replied pleasantly. “You survive most of your habits.”
Mosby snorted. “You’re easy to find when you want to be.”
“And difficult when I do not,” the Talari agreed. “Balance is important.”
He inclined his head slightly — a greeting, not quite a bow. Mosby noticed the lack of visible augmentation, the easy way he held himself, the fact that no one nearby seemed inclined to look too closely at him.
“So,” the Talari said. “What has made you careless enough to come looking?”
Mosby studied him for a moment, then gestured toward the empty seat beside him.
“Got a job,” he said. “Complicated. Might get loud in ways I can’t fix from the cockpit.”
The Talari did not sit. He considered the chair, then Mosby, then the surrounding space.
“You require engineering,” he said. “And discretion.”
“And reach,” Mosby added. “Places I can’t ask about without someone noticing.”
A faint movement rippled across the markings on his skin — not interest this time, but something tighter. A calculation that had produced a result he did not like.
“And you thought of me,” he said.
“You were the first,” Mosby replied.
“That is either flattering,” the Talari said, “or concerning.”
“Probably both.”
His mouth — more membrane than lips — curved in something that might have been a smile.
“Friend Mosby,” he said, “you are very bad at small jobs.”
Mosby met his gaze. “This isn’t one.”
Silence stretched between them, filled by the low hum of the station and the distant murmur of people pretending not to listen.
Finally, the Talari nodded once.
“Very well,” he said. “I will need to know where we are going.”
His gaze lingered on Mosby a moment longer than necessary, as if confirming a suspicion he had not yet chosen to voice.
Mosby exhaled slowly.
“Get aboard,” he said. “I’ll explain what I can.”
The Talari turned, already moving.
“And Mosby?” he added, without looking back.
“Yeah?”
“Please do not attempt my name this time.”
Mosby smiled despite himself.
“No promises,” he said.
The Talari paused just long enough for that to register.
“Then I will attempt to forgive you,” he replied, and disappeared into the flow of the station.


By the time Mosby returned to the berth, Ted already knew which ship was his.
The Farther Star wore her usual riot of color and symbol over old military plating, but Ted slowed as he reached the ramp, head tilting slightly.
Something had been added.
Along the forward flank, just below the cockpit line, the stylized eye stared outward, paint still sharp where age and dust hadn’t touched it yet.
“This was not here before,” Ted said.
Mosby glanced up from where he was checking a cargo strap near the open bay. “Manny’s been busy.”
“Manny,” Ted repeated.
“Local artist,” Mosby said. “Self-appointed.”
Ted studied the new eyes a moment longer, the mineral sheen of his gaze narrowing. “He adds protection,” he said quietly.
Mosby snorted. “He adds whatever he feels like.”
Ted didn’t look away. “That is also protection.”

A soft metallic thud echoed inside the cargo bay as someone set a crate down harder than necessary.
Ted’s attention shifted.
Sael stepped into view from deeper in the bay, sleeves rolled, a datapad in one hand. She had changed since Mosby had left for the station’s upper tiers — the tailored lines she’d worn to the Thalean consulate replaced now with muted, practical travel gear. Only the cut of the fabric, and the way she carried herself, marked her as anything other than another spacer passing through.
She took in the Talari in a single, assessing glance.
“Ted,” Mosby said, jerking his thumb in introduction. “Best engineer I know who doesn’t ask for paperwork.”
Ted inclined his head. “Mosby has low standards for documentation.”
Sael met his gaze. “I am Sael.”
Ted’s eyes shifted to her, focus sharpening slightly.
“Yes,” Ted said. “Sael Vareni ir’Elisand.”
The datapad in her hand went still.
A fractional pause — small enough that Mosby might have missed it, large enough that Ted did not.
“I see,” she said.
Mosby looked between them. “Do you know each other?”
Ted’s gaze remained on her. “I have never seen her,” he said. “Nor has she met me.”
Another beat.
Sael inclined her head slightly. “But you know who I am.”
“Yes,” Ted said simply.
Mosby frowned. “How?”
Ted shifted one shoulder in a small, almost apologetic motion. “Talari notice things,” he said. “We remember. We speak to one another. Information travels.”
Sael regarded him steadily. “That leaves a great deal to interpretation.”
Ted’s gaze did not waver. “No,” he said. “It leaves what was.”  He paused “We do not infer,” he added. “We perceive.”
Mosby shifted in his stance, arms folding loosely. “Well that sounds spookie as hell.”
Ted considered this. “It is often said.”
His eyes drifted briefly past them, toward the painted eyes along the Star’s hull outside the open ramp.
“Sometimes,” he added quietly, “it is also how things survive.”
The hum of the station drifted in through the ramp. Somewhere down the dock, a cargo hauler cycled its thrusters and the deck vibrated faintly underfoot.
Mosby clapped his hands once. “Well, that’s reassuring.”
He jerked his head toward the interior. “Come on, Ted. I’ll show you the engine compartment. Try not to insult it too loudly.”
“I know the way, Friend Mosby,” Ted said. “I am well aware of your failings to maintain it to my standards.”
Mosby snorted. “No one could, Ted.”
Sael watched him go, expression unreadable.
“That,” she said quietly to Mosby, “is not just an engineer.”
Mosby grinned faintly. “Nope. No one better to buy, borrow, or scrounge, though. We’re going to need him.”
He followed Ted inside.
Sael lingered at the ramp a moment longer, looking out at the painted hull and the layered symbols that meant nothing to her.
One of the new eyes seemed to be looking back.
Inside, Ted had already opened two access panels in engineering and was explaining, with patient disapproval, why Mosby’s definition of “running fine” differed significantly from his own.
“These thermal regulators,” Ted was saying, one long finger tracing a faint heat scar along a conduit, “are still within tolerance. They should not be.”
Mosby leaned against a bulkhead with the long-suffering expression of a man who had heard this before. “They’ve got personality.”
“They have damage,” Ted replied.
Mosby shrugged. “Same thing.”
Ted made a small sound that might have been a sigh in another species. “We will need spare regulators. And a better diagnostic array than the one you pretend is adequate.”
Mosby scratched the back of his neck. “I was hoping you’d say we’re perfect and can leave tomorrow.”
Ted’s eyes shifted toward him. “I have never once said that.”
“Worth a shot,” Mosby muttered.
Ted adjusted a panel setting, then added, “There are also several components I would prefer to replace before departure.”
Mosby raised an eyebrow. “How expensive is ‘prefer’?”
Ted considered. “Moderately.”
Mosby jerked a thumb toward the cargo bay. “Put it on the mission account.”
Sael, leaning in the doorway, folded her arms. “I don’t remember authorizing—”
Mosby pointed at her. “She gets the bill.”
Ted inclined his head. “In that case, the list will be extensive.”
Sael sighed.
Mosby looked pleased. “See? Everybody wins.”
An hour later, Mosby was halfway into an access panel he’d been meaning to check for weeks when—
The knock on the hull was sharp and impatient.
He looked up. “Yeah, yeah,” he muttered, wiping his hands on a rag as he headed down the cargo ramp. “Hold your thrusters.”
By the time the ramp lowered the rest of the way, a skinny kid was already standing at the bottom, bouncing on the balls of his feet like the station gravity couldn’t quite hold him down. His jacket had been patched so many times it had become its own design. A faded relay satchel hung crosswise over his chest.
“Delivery for the Farther Star,” the kid said, chin up, voice already defensive.
Mosby looked him over. Quick eyes. Quick hands. Not scared — just measuring.
“Relay office start hiring children now?” Mosby asked.
“Cheaper than bots,” the kid shot back. “You Mosby or not?”
“Depends who’s asking.”
The kid held up a slim pad. “Sign and I stop caring.”
Mosby snorted and pressed his thumb to the pad. As he handed it back, he flicked a few extra credits onto the screen.
The kid’s eyes widened for half a second before he covered it with a shrug. “Didn’t see nothing,” he said.
“Smart,” Mosby replied. “Stay that way.”
The kid jogged off.
Mosby climbed back up the ramp, flipping through the printed relay slips as he walked.
“Route coverage confirmed… parts shipment delayed… Jacobson complaining about berth fees again…” He shook his head.
Ted stepped closer. “May I see those?”
Mosby handed them over. “Anything interesting?”
Ted held two slips side by side.
“There’s two of that one,” Mosby said. “Relay office glitch.”
Ted did not answer.
Sael stepped closer. “Duplicate transmission?”
“They look identical,” Mosby said.
“They are not,” Ted replied.
He pointed to a single altered character.
Sael frowned. “It’s a transmission artifact.”
“No,” Ted said gently. “This one was altered.”
Mosby rubbed his chin. “Meaning what? Somebody snooping?”
Ted examined the text carefully.
“This is the sort of error made when something handles symbols without understanding them.”
Mosby blinked. “You’re telling me somebody read my mail and fat-fingered the alphabet?”
“In essence,” Ted said.
Sael crossed her arms. “Customs AIs scrub traffic all the time.”
“Yes,” Ted agreed. “But their systems make consistent substitutions. This is not consistent.”
Mosby took the slips back slowly. “So what does that mean?”
Ted’s eyes shifted slightly.
“It means this message passed through something that does not think in this script… but wanted to see it anyway.”
Silence pooled in the bay.
Mosby folded the slips and slid them into his jacket.
“Great,” he muttered. “Someone is taking an interest in us.”
Ted did not disagree.
Mosby looked between the two slips again, then shoved his hands into his pockets.
“Okay. Change of plan.” He turned toward Ted. “Can the Star make a direct jump to Sol?”
Sael blinked. “Sol? That’s not on the route.”
“Yeah,” Mosby said. “That’s the point.”
Ted was still for a moment, eyes shifting faintly as he ran the numbers.
“There are complications,” he said at last.
Mosby folded his arms. “Define ‘complications.’”
“The drive field was tuned for staged transits and gate alignments,” Ted said. “A single independent jump of that length will increase containment drift and thermal load. Regulator wear will accelerate.”
“Distance?” Mosby asked.
“Ten-point-five light-years,” Ted replied. “Within operational tolerance. I can correct the drift in transit, but the assemblies will experience additional strain.”
Mosby shrugged. “We’ll worry about that later.”
Ted’s gaze held on him a fraction longer. “Later may arrive sooner than you prefer.”
“Story of my life.”
Sael looked between them. “You’re talking about bypassing the gate network entirely.”
“Yep,” Mosby said. “If somebody’s watching traffic patterns, they’re watching gates. We drop off the map for a while. See who notices.”
She considered that, expression tightening slightly. “And if whoever altered that message can still follow you off-grid?”
Mosby met her eyes. “Then we learn something useful.”
He turned toward Ted. “Get what we need. Be quick about it.”
Ted paused. “That will be expensive.”
Mosby did not hesitate. “Do it.”
Ted inclined his head once and moved toward engineering, already reprioritizing systems and supply lists.
Mosby pushed off the bulkhead and headed for the cockpit. “I’m going to start on the flight plans. One to file now, and another just before we jump. Let’s go someplace inconvenient.”
Sael lingered a moment longer, looking toward the cargo ramp, where the station traffic lights blinked in orderly patterns against the dark.
A system built on schedules. Registries. Predictable movement.
Mosby was about to step outside all of it.
She exhaled once, then followed.
