# Faction, Government, and Institutional Naming
Status: CANON  
Purpose: Prevent semantic drift and category errors

## Naming Discipline

Names in the Astraeum must signal function.

If a name implies:
- sovereignty
- territory
- citizenship
- coercive authority

Then it must refer to a government.

---

## Governments (Polities)

Governments:
- control territory
- maintain fleets or enforcement arms
- collect resources
- claim legitimacy through law or force

Examples:
- Solarian Concord
- Astraeum Protectorate
- Heliad Trade League

---

## Institutions

Institutions:
- cross borders
- grant legitimacy
- certify behavior
- influence outcomes indirectly

They do not rule territory.

Example:
- Lumenary Synod

Do not append governmental language to institutional names.

---

## Theological Language Constraint

Religious or doctrinal language may exist within:
- institutions
- cultures
- movements

It must not imply:
- divine mandate over physics
- universal metaphysical truth
- guaranteed outcomes

---

## Reformation Dynamics

Where institutions persist:
- reform movements will emerge
- schisms will form
- reinterpretations will compete

These movements may:
- reject central authority
- intensify belief
- attempt secularization
- be co-opted by states

Reformation is expected, not exceptional.

---

## Terminology Restrictions

Avoid:
- “cult” (use sect, movement, order, school)
- “empire” unless territorially accurate
- “church” unless explicitly self-identified

Language shapes reader assumptions.
